# Relevant Ideas
* Use of keybindings to translate user input from ascii to morse code  
* Use of Firebase server api to allow online communication  
* Choice of user name or randomly generated Anonymous tag for users (simulated "log-in" system -- username is stored as global variable that is sent to the firebase server with each user message)  
* Changing html with jquery to simulate screen transitions  
* Cross-Platform support (depends on browser support of javascript.  Third-party mobile browsers and mobile google chrome still incur issues with javascript functions)
